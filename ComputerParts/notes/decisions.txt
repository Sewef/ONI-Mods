add instructions:
---------------
halt
dequeue

use ROMS as instruction decoders (make 2?  make 16 bit output?)
allow edit of memory content?

multiplexing clock
-------------
game clock (no clock) ("render every tick")
single bit clock (edge triggered)
start transmission rising edge clock
start transmission rising edge clock + single bit clock (edge triggered)
ribbon clock

multiplexing
-------------
on multiplexer, have option of whether is 2 bits or 4 bits or 8 bits? (default 8, allow copy settings)

1-bit over a wire = 1 bits
1-bit over a ribbons = 4 bits
1-bit over 2 ribbons = 8 bits

4-bits over a wire = 4 bits
4-bits over a ribbon = 16 bits
4-bits over 2 ribbons = 32 bits

8-bits over a wire = 8 bits
8-bits over a ribbon = 32 bits
8-bits over 2 ribbon = 64 bits

16-bits over a wire = 16 bits
16-bits over a ribbon = 64 bits
16-bits over 2 ribbons = 128 bits

data tansmission
---------------
8-bit
16-bit
32-bit

FPU sub-circuit?
----------------

processor interrupts?
