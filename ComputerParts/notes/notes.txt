16-bit
have code stored in memory (64k)
clock is internal, every game tick.

clock out, data available bit.

data pins are for i/o, use an input queue, edge triggered read

irq lines


16 data queues, each higher priority.  first memory addresses are pointers to where to start execution
0 is the idle thread
cpu protects stack integrity between threads, and does call stack

each data channel has its own pair of stacks and its own instruction pointer.
a push on an empty queue makes it drop to a lower priority thread
a pop on an empty stack clears the stacks, and resets the instruction pointer.

00 address low out 
01 address high out

0001 - 1 - peek - (send top of stack to data out)
0011 - 3 - push - (push data in to top of stack)

ribbon a (read channel selector)
===============================
channel read selector (3 bits) 
1bb stacks, 

? other stack
001 instruction pointer, 
010 i/o data,
011 instruction value (load immediate)

00 - predicate
01 - stack
10 - transfer
11 - ?

ribbon b (write channel)
===============================
channel write selector (3 bits) 
001 instruction pointer, 
010 i/o data, 011 i/o address

read:
data, stack1, stack2, ip, 
write enable conditional (which flag, which value w bits)
only use flags on one stack

write:
data, address

transfer
predicate
00 stack op
01 transfer op
10 flow control



expand muxes and demuxes to use ribbons?
4-bit truth table PLC/ROM
bit switches for values:
0000
0001
... etc.

can copy settings

also have presets:
AND
OR
PARITY
0...15
bit1
bit2
bit3
bit4

4:4 TRUTH TABLE / PLC / ROM

if wire is connected, only outputs 1 bit.
