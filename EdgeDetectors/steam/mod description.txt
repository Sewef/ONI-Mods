[i][b]Note:[/b] The mod has been renamed in the mods view from "Some Logic Gates" to "Edge Detectors and Diode"[/i]

[list]
[*]Falling Edge Detector
[*]Rising Edge Detector
[*]Diode
[*]Rising Edge Counter
[/list]

[h1]Rising Edge Detector[/h1]
Sends a green signal for one tick when the input goes from red to green.

[h1]Falling Edge Detector[/h1]
Sends a green signal for one tick when the input goes from green to red.

[h1]Rising Edge Counter [i](NEW!)[/i][/h1]
Counts the number of times a rising edge is observed and outputs that in binary to a ribbon.

[h1]Diode[/h1]
Copies input to output.
The diode can be used to de-couple logic circuits, and/or to create OR gates with any number of inputs (just connect the outputs together, and that's your OR gate.)

(Note also to make arbitrarily large AND gates, you just do the same thing with NOT gates, and then add a NOT gate to the output.)

A AND B = NOT (NOT A OR NOT B)
A OR B = NOT (NOT A AND NOT B)



My first mod ever. :-) More to come.
